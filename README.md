StatinMyopathy
==============

We developed two text based methods to identify statin induced myotoxicity from electronic medical records (EMRs):

1. Extract statin allergies from:
   *   Problem lists
   *   High value documents processed with [SecTag](http://knowledgemap.mc.vanderbilt.edu/research/content/sectag-tagging-clinical-note-section-headers) to identify Allergy and Adverse Reactions sections.
